[big]#Subsurface-mobile for Android: USER MANUAL#

*Manual author*: Willem Ferguson

toc::[]

[blue]#_Beta release, February 2016_#

IMPORTANT: For this BETA release it is critical that users report any problems
with the use of the mobile software. After all, one of the objectives
of a beta release is to distribute the software to a broader circle
of users using different Android devices and configurations in order to
iron out any bugs, errors or inconsistencies. Please report
such issues by email to subsurface@subsurface-divelog.org

Welcome as a user of _Subsurface_, an advanced dive logging program with
extensive infrastructure to describe, organize, interpret and print scuba
and free dives. _Subsurface_ offers many advantages over other similar
software solutions, including compatibility with Windows, Mac-OS/X, Linux (many
distributions) as well as Android. In addition, _Subsurface_ allows downloading dive
information from most dive computers. _Subsurface_ software is open-source.

Introducing Subsurface-mobile
-----------------------------

_Subsurface-mobile_ is an extension of _Subsurface_ that runs on laptop and
tabletop computers. It runs on Android smartphone and tablet devices and is a
tool for viewing or sharing dive information at dive sites. It also allows
the gathering of GPS locations where dives are performed.

While _Subsurface-mobile_ allows one to enter and save dive information
using an Android device, users of _Subsurface-mobile_ typically use the
mobile app as an extension of the laptop/desktop version of _Subsurface_.
This allows the storage of dive logs on the Internet and which
can be shared by the Android version as well as the desktop version.
While the desktop version of _Subsurface_ shows much more detailed information
for each dive, the mobile version allows one to have a more accessible dive log
on a dive trip, useful for proving dive experience to dive shops or to review
previous dives. _Subsurface-mobile_ allows one to:

- Download existing dive log information from the Internet.
- View this information on an Android device.
- Edit many of the dive log data fields, e.g. divemaster, buddy,
  equipment or notes about a dive.
- Create and add new dive records to one's dive log.
- Store the updated dive log on the Internet.
- Record, store and apply GPS positions of dives.
- View the localities of recorded GPS positions and of dives
  on a map.

These items are discussed in greater detail in the following text.

== Installing _Subsurface-mobile_ on an Android device

Install _Subsurface-mobile_ from the Google
Play Store. Search for _Subsurface-mobile_ and install it.

== Using _Subsurface-mobile_ for the first time

Upon starting _Subsurface-mobile_ for the first time, a Subsurface
splash screen is shown while the program loads. On some devices this
may take several seconds. After loading, the _landing screen_ appears
(see image on left, below). There are three options.

image::mobile-images/landingscreen.jpg["FIGURE: Mobile landing screen",align="center"]

Since _Subsurface_ is largely dependent on a dive log saved on the Internet,
select the top option "Connect to Cloudstorage" and enter an email address
and password for access to the _Subsurface_ Internet storage server. If
you do not have credentials to log in, this is obtained through the
desktop version of _Subsurface_. When entering a password, it is possible to check
a checkbox that enables the text of the password to be shown. Checking the
check box labelled "Remember" allows _Susburface-mobile_ to keep the
credentials for subsequent logins (see image on right, above).
Having entered the credentials, tap "Save".
_Subsurface-mobile_ attempts to download the existing dive log from the
Internet server. Appropriate messages are shown onscreen. Finally
a list of dives are shown (image on left, below).

For the beta release, do not choose the options "Transfer from dive computer" or "Add dive manually"

== Local copy of the dive log and synchronisation with Internet

Once the dive
list has been downloaded from the Internet, _Subsurface-mobile_ keeps a local
copy on the Android device. This means that, if there is no Internet connection
at a dive site, one can still access the local copy and view and manipulate
dive information. If there is Internet connectivity, _Subsurface-mobile_ accesses
the Internet-based dive log to verify that the local copy is still the
same as the Internet-stored copy. If not, the local copy is synchronised with the version on
the Internet.

== The Action Button

At the bottom of of most Subsurface-mobile screens is a round button that provides
information and enables several actions. The Action Button often has one
or more triangular arrow points. Arrows alongside the _Action Button_ indicate
drag movements that are available by dragging the _Action Button_. Arrows indicate
that one or more _Action Screens_ are available(i.e. menus that become visible as side
panels)  On the other hand icons inside the _Action Button_ indicate
specific actions that can be performed by tapping the button. Examples of different
formats of the _Action Button_ are presented in the images below:


[icon="mobile-images/Left.jpg"]
[IMPORTANT]
This action button indicates that an _Action Panel_ can be viewed
by dragging the _Action Button_ to the right. Doing this exposes the main _Action Panel_
that allows many actions with respect to one's dive log. The different _Action Panels_
are described below.

[icon="mobile-images/LeftRight.jpg"]
[IMPORTANT]
This action button indicates that one of two different _Action Panels_ can be viewed
by dragging the _Action Button_ either to the right or to the left.

[icon="mobile-images/Edit.jpg"]
[IMPORTANT]
This action button contains an icon that indicates that, in addition to the drag action
described above, one can edit a dive by tapping the _Action Button_.

[icon="mobile-images/Quit.jpg"]
[IMPORTANT]
This action button contains an icon that indicates that, in addition to the drag action
described above, one can abord an edit of dive data by tapping the _Action Button_.


== Viewing the Dive List

Most of the actions of _Subsurface-mobile_ center around the dives on the
dive list. One can scroll up and down the dive list. Tapping a dive on
the list brings up a display of _Details View_ for that dive.
This includes the dive profile as well as additional information and notes
(see image on right, below).

One can view other dives by swiping the _Details view_ to the right (for the
previous dive) or to the left (following dive).

image::mobile-images/divelist.jpg["FIGURE: Dive list screen",align="center"]

== Editing dive details.

At the bottom of the screen an _Action Button_
allows aditional actions with respect to a dive that is being shown. In the
details screen (image on right, above) the action button shows a pencil.
Tapping the button brings up a panel with edit boxes that allows one to
change the existing dive information, e.g. adding text to the dive notes
or changing the names or values of some of the information (see image below).
It may be necessary to scroll the window to access all the information.
At the bottom of the edit screen is a "Save" button. Tap this to save
the new information. Having saved the data, the dive list screen is
shown. To cancel any edits, tap the Action Button.

image::mobile-images/editdive.jpg["FIGURE: Dive edit screen",align="center"]

== Dive log management

A central  part of _Subsurface-mobile_ is the ability to store the dive log on the Internet.
This provides security against loss or damage to the dive information caintained in a local copy of
the dive log. This ability is accessed throug the Action Panel. Drag the Action Button to the right.
(alternatively tap the Menu button at the top left of the Android screen).
This brings up the Action Panel (image on left, below). Tap the option "Manage dives" (image below in middle).

=== Upload dive log to the Internet

Assuming that the correct credentials have been specified, one can upload the dives contained on the Androis device
to the Internet by tapping the option "Upload to cloud". This saves the local
copy of the dive log to the cloud.

=== Download dive log from the Internet

In the dive management subpanel, tap the option "Refresh" (image below in middle). This causes
the local divelog to be refreshed from the cloud so that the Internet and local versions are synchronised.


image::mobile-images/managedive.jpg["FIGURE: Dive management subpanel",align="center"]

=== Add dive manually

Dives can easily be entered by hand. This allows one to describe a dive and add it to the dive log.
In the dive management subpanel tap "Add dive manually". The edit screen opens (image above on right).
Fill in all the appropriate information, then tap the "Save" button at the bottom of the screen. It may be
necessary to scroll down to see the "Save" button. The dive is then saved as part of the dive log. In the
details dive view, a profile of the dive is created.

== Recording dive locations using GPS.

The fact that most smartphones have GPS facilities allows one to record
the locations of dives. One can take the smartphone on the dive boat
during a dive and locations will be automatically recorded at regular intervals.

=== Setting up the GPS

Drag the Action Button to the right. This brings up the Action Panel (image
on left, above). Select "Preferences". Now specify the way
in which GPS data need to be automatically collected (image on left, below). One can specify that
data are collected at regular intervals, e.g. every 10 minutes, or at regular
distances, e.g. after the boat has moved more than 200m, or a combination of
both of the above approaches. Provide the appropriate information and
tap the "Save" button. The program is now ready to collect GPS positions.

image::mobile-images/gpssetup.jpg["FIGURE: GPS setup screen",align="center"]

=== Collecting GPS positions

Ensure that the GPS on the Android device has been activated. At the bottom
of the Action Panel is a check box "Run location service" (image on right, above).
Check this box
and _Subsurface-mobile_ starts to collect GPS locations automatically,
following the preferences specified as described above. After
the dive one can deactivate the collection of GPS data by de-activating
the same check box at the bottom of the Action Panel.

=== Storing the GPS data

Activate the Action Panel (image on right, above) by drawing the Action Button to the right.
Select the "GPS" option that brings up a submenu of GPS-related actions
(image on left, below). Tap "Upload GPS data" that saves the GPS data
on the _Subsurface_ Internet server. These GPS data are saved separately
from the other dive log data. All collected GPS data are kept on the
Android device, independent of whether they have been uploaded or not.

=== Viewing GPS data

From the GPS submenu (image on left, below) select "Show GPS fixes". This brings
up a list of GPS positions obtained using the location service (image
in middle, below). Two actions are possible for each of the locations, enabled if
one taps the handle (the three horisontal stripes on the right, see image in middle, below) and
then drags the specific item to the left (image on right, below). This exposes two
options. Tapping the dustbin deletes this particular GPS location. Tapping the
teardrop-shaped icon (actually a Google Maps pin) opens up Google Maps with a pin
indicating the exact map position of the record being viewed. The two above
options can be hidden by drawing the GPS record to the right, again using the handle.

== Saving GPS positions on the Internet

One can save the collected GPS data on the Internet by
selecting "Upload GPS Data" from the GPS submanu (Image on left, below).

=== Downloading GPS data from the Internet

One can download the GPS data that have been saved on the Internet by
selecting "Download GPS Data" from the GPS subpanel (Image on left, below).

image::mobile-images/gpsmanagement.jpg["FIGURE: GPS management",align="center"]

=== Applying GPS data to dives in the dive log

Assuming that all the dives have been entered into the dive log or have
been downloaded from the Internet, one can apply the GPS positions to
these dives. GPS positions can therefore only be applied to dives in the dive log.
From the GPS subpanel, tap "Apply GPS fixes" (image on left, above). The dive log contains the start
and end times of each dive. Now, _Subsurface-mobile_ applies the first
GPS position that falls within the dive period of each dive. This results
in a GPS position for each dive that is saved as part of the dive log.

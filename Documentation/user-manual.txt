[[S_Introduction]]
Introduction:
-------------

Subsurface is an open source divelog program that runs on Windows, Mac
and Linux.

With Subsurface the user can download dive information directly from a
large number of supported dive computers. Alternatively dives can be
imported from a number of other divelog programs of web
services. Dives can also be manually entered.

Subsurface is able to track single- and multi-tank dives using air,
Nitrox or TriMix. It displays a dive profile with all related
information including air consumption and alarms. It also allows
logging of information like weights and exposure protection used, dive
masters and dive buddies and enables the user to rate dives and
provide additional dive notes.

With Subsurface the user can track dive locations including GPS
coordinates (which can also be conveniently entered using a map
interface). Subsurface calculates a wide variety of statistics of the
user's diving and keeps track of information like the user's SAC rate,
partial pressures of O2, N2 and He, calculated deco information, and
many more.

Subsurface allows the user to print out a detailed log book including
dive profiles and other relevant information. The program is localized
in more than a dozen languages and well supported by an active
developer community.

While the list of supported dive computers is very long, in this
manual the Suunto Vyper will be used for most examples.


[[S_Requirements]]
Requirements
------------

Before you are able to import information from your dive computer into
Subsurface, you need some preparation. Do you have the following:

	1. Your Dive Computer - compatible with libdivecomputer (see list in <<AppendixA,Appendix A>>)
	2. Communication interface - usually that means a cable to connect your dive computer to your PC/Laptop/Netbook; some dive computers use IRDA or Bluetooth as well
	3. Working installation of Subsurface
	4. If needed, the manual of your dive computer

Alternatively you can import your divelogs from a couple of other
divelog applications (JDiveLog, MacDive, Suunto Dive Manager,
divelogs.de as well as any application that can export to UDDF).
However, native download from dive computer directly to Subsurface is
recommended.


[[S_StartUsing]]
Start Using the Program
-----------------------

When you start the program for the first time, it shows no information
at all. This is because the program doesn't have any information available.
If you have used the program before and saved the data, the program will
automatically load the already available divelog files.

There is a menu, containing 'File', 'Log', 'View', 'Filter', 'Planner' and 'Help'.

The screen is divided in 3 area's (shown below with test dives loaded):

 - Area with 4 tabs: Dive Notes, Equipment, Dive Info, and Stats
 - Area next to the 4 tabs which will contain the dive profile
 - Area with the dives (usually called dive list) which can be sorted by number, date, etc.

image::images/main_window.png["The Main Window",align="center"]

[[S_DiveProfile]]
Dive Profile and Included information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dive profile shown on the main screen is loaded with information.
However, great effort was taken to keep the profile simple, yet
informative.

The main information of the dive profile is the depth graph. On top of
the obvious information of the depth it also shows the ascent and
descent rate compared to the recommended speed of going up or down in
the water column. This information is given using different
colors. Dark red means ascent faster than 18m/60ft per minute or
decent faster than 30m/100ft per minute. Orange implies an ascent
speed range between 9m and 18m (between 30 and 60ft) per minute (or
descent between 18m and 30m (60ft - 100ft) per minute). Yellow and
light green represent even slower speeds and dark green represents
reasonably stable situations where the vertical speed is between +/-
1.5m or 5ft per minute.

The depth graph also includes depth readings for the peaks in the
graph. Thus you should see the depth of the deepest point and other
peaks. Average depth is marked with a horizontal red line.

The air consumption graph displays the tank pressure and its change
during the dive.  The air consumption takes depth into account so that
even when manually entering the start and end pressures the graph is
not a straight line. Similarly to the depth graph the tank pressure
gives you information about the momentary SAC rate (Surface Air
Consumtion - often also called RMV - Respiratory Minute Volume) when
using an air integrated dive
computer. Here the color coding is not relative to some absolute
values but relative to the average normalized air consumption during
the dive. So areas that are red or orange indicate times of increased
normalized air consumption while dark green reflects times when the
diver was using less gas than average. Please note that the color
coding is obviously only possible when a tank sensor is connected and
tank pressure readings during the dive are available.

Water temperature is displayed with its own blue line with degree
markings placed adjacent to significant changes.

It is possible to zoom into the profile graph. This is done either
by using the scroll wheel / scroll gesture of your mouse or trackpad
or by holding down the left mouse button; the zoom area can be changed
by moving the mouse around the profile. There is also a toggle zoom
under the 'Log' menu that changes the scale of the dive to fill the
whole area, useful especially for free divers. By default Subsurface
always shows a profile area large enough for at least 30 minutes and
30m (100ft) - this way short or shallow dives are intuitively
recognizable; something that free divers clearly won't care about.

[[S_TecDiveProfile]]
Tec Information in Dive Profile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dive profile can include further information that is typically
more interesting for tec divers. Enabling these is described
in chapter <<S_SettingUpPreferences,Setting up
Preferences>>. Basically you can include graphs of the partial
pressures O2, N2, and He during the dive as well as a calculated
and dive computer reported deco ceilings (only visible for deep,
long, or repetitive dives).

The partial pressure graphs are added below the profile data, the
calculated ceiling is shown as a green overlay on top of the dive
profile. Above the profile the currently used gradient factors are
shown (e.g. GF 35/75). Please note that these are NOT the gradient
factors in use by the dive computer in question, but the gradient
factors used by Subsurface to calculate deco obligations during the
dive.

The graph can also include the dive computer reported ceiling (or more
precisely, the first deco stop that the dive computer recorded - note
that not all dive computers record this information and make it
available for download; for example all of the Suunto dive computers
fail to make this very useful data available to divelog
software). Because of the differences in used algorithms and amount of
data available (and taken into consideration) at the time of the
calculation it is unlikely that both of these are the same; this can
be true even if the same algorithm and gradient factors are used. It
is also quite common that Subsurface calculates a ceiling for
non-decompression dives when the dive computer stayed in non-deco mode
during the whole dive. This is caused by the fact that Subsurface's
calculations describe the deco obligation at that point in time during
a dive, while dive computers usually take the upcoming ascent into
account. During the ascent some excess Nitrogen (and possibly Helium)
are already breathed off so even though the diver technically
encountered a 'ceiling' at depth, the dive still does not require an
explicit deco stop. This feature allows dive computers to offer longer
'non-stop bottom time'.

[[S_DiveList]]
Dive List
~~~~~~~~~

Information in the dive list is taken from different sources. Either
through <<S_ImportingAlienDiveLogs,imports from other diving log
software>> or a <<S_ImportNewDives,dive computer>> or manually entered.
Additional columns can be added through
<<S_SettingUpPreferences,preferences>>.
Existing data can be <<S_EditDiveInfo,manually edited>>, too.

Because of the inaccuracy of depth gauge of diving computers depth
 >20m are shown rounded to the next meter. Despite this the provided
depth is kept in the logfile. Users of imperial system aren't affected
by this.

An innovative feature in Subsurface is the ability to group dives by
"trips". What this means is that multiple dives can be categorized
together under a common header. Typically this is used by divers who
travel for a limited time to a dive destiation - the location in the
trip header can then be used for the destination information
("Phillippines, Puerto Galera"), while the location in the individual
dive can describe the actual dive site ("Hole in the wall").

Subsurface usually does a very good job detecting and grouping dive
trips together. To use this feature simply enable the "Autogroup"
option in the "Log" menu entry. Alternatively, you can select multiple
dives in the dive list and use the context menu (right click on one of
the selected dives) to create a trip. The context menu contains
several additional options to allow manipulation of trips - these
should be self-explanatory.

[[S_ImportNewDives]]
Import New Dives from your Dive Computer
---------------------------------------

[NOTE]
Some dive computers consume more power when they are in their
PC-Communication mode. **This could drain your battery**. We therefore
recommend that you check if your dive computer is recharging when
connected to the USB port of a PC. The Suunto Vyper for example does
not recharge through the USB connection. Please consult the manual of
your dive computer if you are unsure if it will recharge or drain its
batteries while connected to the USB port.

Now it is time to hook up your dive computer to your PC:

 - Make sure that your OS has the required drivers installed

	* On Linux this means you need to have the correct kernel
	  module loaded. Most distributions will do this automatically
	  for you. Make sure you have read/write permissions to that
	  port. On Ubuntu that could mean you should run the command
	  following command in a terminal window:

	sudo adduser [your_username] dialout

	* On Windows, the OS should offer to download the correct
	  driver when you connect your dive computer to the USB port.

	* On a Mac you at times have to manually hunt for the correct
	  driver. For example the correct driver for the Mares Puck
	  devices can be found as Mac_OSX_VCP_Driver.zip at
	  http://www.silabs.com/support/pages/support.aspx?ProductFamily=USB+Bridges
	  (see further hints in <<AppendixB,Appendix B>>)

 - Connect your interface cable to a free USB port (or setup the Infrared
	or Bluetooth connection as described later in this manual)

 - Put your dive computer into PC Communication mode. (For 'Suunto Vyper', press Mode - 1 Memory - 3 TR-PC)
	(You should consult the manual of your specific dive computer for your brand and type)

 - In Subsurface go to 'Log - Download From Dive Computer'
	* Using the two drop down lists, choose your vendor and product. Here we choose 'Suunto' and 'Vyper' as is shown on the screenshot below.
	* If the device name drop down list is enabled, select the device name under which your interface is connected from the drop down list.
	* Click the 'OK' button.

image::images/download_dc.png["Download from Dive Computer",align="center"]

 - Now watch how your data is retrieved from your dive computer!
   Depending on your type of computer and/or number of dives, this
   could take some time. Please be patient.

[[S_ImportUemis]]
Import New Dives from a Uemis Zurich
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Things are very similar when downloading dives from a Uemis Zurich
dive computer (which certainly is one of the ones that DO recharge when
connected to the USB port). The main difference is that you don't enter a
device name, but instead the location where the UEMISSDA file system is
mounted once you connect the dive computer.

On Windows this is a drive letter (often 'E:' or 'F:'), on a Mac this is
'/Volumes/UEMISSDA' and on Linux systems this differs depending on the
distribution that you use. On Fedora it usually is
'/var/run/media/<your_username>/UEMISSDA'. In all cases Subsurface
should suggest the correct location in the drop down list.

Once you have selected this as device name you can download the
dives from the Uemis Zurich. One technical issue with the Uemis Zurich
download implementation (this is a firmware limitation, not a
Subsurface issue) is that you cannot download more than about 40-50
dives without running out of memory on the SDA. This will usually only
happen the very first time you download dives from the Uemis Zurich -
normally when downloading at the end of a day or even after a dive
trip, the capacity is sufficient. If Subsurface displays and error
that the dive computer ran out of space the solution is straight
forward.  Disconnect the SDA, turn it off and on again, and reconnect
it. You can now retry (or start a new download session) and the
download will continue where it stopped the last time you tried. You
may have to do this more than once, depending on how many dives you
have stored on your dive computer.

At this point Subsurface downloads most of the information that is
stored on the SDA, including information about dive spots and
equipment. Buddy information is not yet downloaded.


[[S_HowFindDeviceName]]
How to Find the Device Name for USB devices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you connect your dive computer by using an USB connector, usually
Subsurface will either propose a drop down list that contains the
correct device name (or mount point for the Uemis Zurich), or it will
disable the device select drop down is now device name is needed at
all. In the rare cases where this doesn't work here are some
instructions on ways to find out what your dive name is:

.On Windows:

Simply try COM1, COM2, etc. The drop down list should contain all connected COM devices.

.On MacOS:

The drop down box should find all connected dive computers.

.On Linux:

Try the following:

 - Disconnect your USB cable of your dive computer
 - Open a terminal
 - Type the command: 'dmesg' and press enter
 - Plug in your USB cable of your dive computer
 - Type the command: 'dmesg' and press enter

Within your terminal you should see a message similar to this one:

	usb 2-1.1: new full speed USB device number 14 using ehci_hcd
	usbcore: registered new interface driver usbserial
	USB Serial support registered for generic
	usbcore: registered new interface driver usbserial_generic
	usbserial: USB Serial Driver core
	USB Serial support registered for FTDI USB Serial Device
	ftdi_sio 2-1.1:1.0: FTDI USB Serial Device converter detected
	usb 2-1.1: Detected FT232BM
	usb 2-1.1: Number of endpoints 2
	usb 2-1.1: Endpoint 1 MaxPacketSize 64
	usb 2-1.1: Endpoint 2 MaxPacketSize 64
	usb 2-1.1: Setting MaxPacketSize 64
	usb 2-1.1: FTDI USB Serial Device converter now attached to ttyUSB3
	usbcore: registered new interface driver ftdi_sio
	ftdi_sio: v1.6.0:USB FTDI Serial Converters Driver

You see that in the third line from the bottom, the USB adapter is
detected and is connected to 'ttyUSB3'. Now you use this information in
the import settings as '/dev/ttyUSB3'. Your dive computer interface is
connected and you should be able to import your dives.

[[S_HowFindBluetoothDeviceName]]
Setting up bluetooth enabled devices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For dive computers communicating through bluetooth like the Heinrichs
Weikamp Frog or the Shearwater Predator and Petrel there is a
different procedure to get the devices name to communicate with
subsurface. In general it consists of these steps:

 * enable bluetooth on your computer
 * pairing the device

Please do not forget to set your divecomputer in Bluetooth or upload mode before
Paring and Downloading logs. If you use a Shearwater Predator/Petrel just select
'Dive Log+' -> 'Upload Log' and wait until you see the 'Wait PC' message.

.On Windows:

Bluetooth is most likely already enabled. For pairing the device choose
Control Panel->Bluetooth Devices->Add Wireless Device
This should bring up a dialog showing your dive computer (in Bluetooth mode) and
allowing to pair it. Choose "0000" as PIN set in your dive computer should work
in most cases, if not, refer to the manufacturer of your dive computer. The dive
computer should then show up in the list of Bluetooth devices and you may then
right click on it and choose Properties->COM Ports to get known of the ports
used for your dive computer. If there are several ports listed, use the one
saying "Outgoing" instead of "Incoming".

image::images/bluetooth_properties.png["Edit Dive Info",align="center"]

Downloading in Subsurface, the drop down list should contain this COM
port already, if not enter it manually.

Note: If you have issues downloading from your dive computer in other software
afterwards try to remove the pairing to get it working again (proven to work for
Shearwater Desktop).

.On MacOS:

Click on the Bluetooth symbol in the menu bar and select 'Set up
Bluetooth Device...'. Make sure that your dive computer is in upload
mode; it should then show up in the list of devices. Select it and go
through the pairing process. This step should only be needed once for
initial setup.

Once the pairing is completed the correct device will be shown in the
'Device or Mount Point' drop down in the Subsurface Download dialog.

.On Linux
Please make sure you have bluetooth enabled on your computer running Subsurface.
On most common distributions this should be true out of the box, if not then
depending on your system running initd or systemd this might be different and
also involve loading modules specific to your hardware. In case your system is
running systemd manually run 'sudo systemctl start bluetooth.service' to enable
it, in case of initd run something like 'sudo rc.config start bluetoothd' or
'sudo /etc/init.d/buetooth start'.

Pairing should be straight forward. Using Gnome3 for instance will show a
bluetooth icon in the upper right corner of your desktop where you select 'Set
up New Device'. This should show you a dialog where you are able to select your
dive computer (in bluetooth mode) and pair it. If you have issues with PIN
setting try manually setting '0000'.

You may also use a manual approach by using such commands:

 * 'sudo hciconfig' - shows the bluetooth devices available on your
computer (not dive computer), most likely you will see a hci0, if not
try 'sudo hcitool -a' to see inactive devices and try to run 'sudo
hciconfig hci0 up' to bring them up

 * 'sudo hcitool scanning'- use this to get a list of bluetooth enabled
client devices, watch out for your dive computer and remember the MAC
address shown there

 * 'sudo bluez-simple-agent hci0 10:00:E8:C4:BE:C4' - this will pair
your dive computer with the bluetooth stack of your computer, copy/paste
the MAC address from the output of 'hcitool scanning'

Unforturnately on Linux binding to a communication device has to be done
manually by running:

 * 'sudo rfcomm bind /dev/rfcomm0 10:00:E8:C4:BE:C4' - bind the dive
computer to a communication device in your computer, in case rfcomm is
already taken just use rfcomm1 or up, please copy/paste the MAC address
from the output of 'hcitool scanning', the MAC shown in here will not
work for you :-).

For downloading dives in subsurface you have then to specify '/dev/rfcomm0'
as device name to use.

Troubleshooting:
Using Bluetooth for downloading from dive computers on Linux seems to be tricky
some times. If you have issues please have a look to the following notes. Using
a Shearwater Predator you may be able to pair but then encounter issues when
downloading, showing errors like "Slip RX: unexp. SLIP END" on the Predator.
This might also be seen, when using other dive log software and operating
systems than Linux. We have no detailed idea about the source and how to fix
this, but it is reported to be solved sometimes by one of these steps:

 * use the bluetooth dongle which came with the Shearwater Predator instead of
   the built-in one of your computer
 * switch to different bluetooth drivers for your hardware
 * switch off WiFi while using Bluetooth

Please report issues and nonworking environments at
http://trac.hohndel.org[our bugtracker] or send an email to
mailto:subsurface@hohndel.org[our mailing list].

[[S_ViewingLogs]]
Viewing and Completing Your Logs
--------------------------------

When all data from your dive computer is transferred, you will see a
listing of your dives in the dive list on the bottom of the Subsurface
window. The columns shown as well as the units used in some of the columns
depend on preference settings. The example below uses metric units and has
some of the more commonly enabled columns explained.

An example:

On Sunday Oct 23, 2011 you made a dive.
In the log line of this dive, you see the following information:
[width="70%",cols="<20%,40%,40%",options="header"]
|===============================================================================
| Header   | Value                   | Description of field
| #	   | 12			     | Dive number
| Date	   | Sun, Oct 23, 2011 10:50 | Date and time of your dive
| *	   |			     | Your rating (none at this time)
| m	   | 12.8		     | Your maximum depth in meters
| min	   | 31:20		     | Your dive-time in minutes and seconds
| Deg. C   | 13.0		     | Lowest water temperature during your dive
| kg       |                         | Weight carried (none at this time)
| Suit     |                         | Exposure protection suit worn (none at this time)
| Cyl	   |			     | Your used cylinder (none at this time)
| O2%	   | air		     | What type of gas you used on the dive
| SAC	   |			     | SAC (none at this time)
| Location |			     | Where you performed your dive (empty)
|===============================================================================

As you can see, some information is already there because it is
retrieved from your dive computer. Some information is waiting for
you to be added.

[NOTE]
In order to edit the dive information, you need to either double-click
on this dive in the dive list, right-click on the dive in the dive
list and select "Edit Dive" from the context menu, or select multiple
dives in the dive list, right click on one of them and then select
"Edit Dives" from the context menu. The last option is especially
useful if you want to edit multiple dives that you just downloaded at
the same time in order to set common attributes (like dive master or
buddy).

As mentioned, the different types of information shown in this list
may differ depending on the settings. More about that in
<<S_SettingUpPreferences,Setting up Preferences>>.

[[S_EditDiveInfo]]
Edit the Dive Info
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you double click on the divelog line as described in
<<S_ViewingLogs,Viewing and Completing Your Logs>>, an editor window
opens as shown in this screenshot:

image::images/edit_dive_info.png["Edit Dive Info",align="center"]

The purpose of the fields is described in the table below:

[width="90%",cols="<33%,67%",options="header"]
|===============================================================================
| Field                      | Description of field
| Dive number, date and time | A button with dive number and date that gives a dialog to edit date/time/depth when clicked
| Location                   | An input where you can enter your new location, or you can choose with the pull-down previous locations
| GPS (WGS84 or GPS format)  | An input where you can enter geographic coordinates of the dive site
| Pick on map                | A button you can click on to display an interactive map on which you can select the location of the dive site
| Dive Master                | An input where you can enter the name of your Dive Master, or you can choose with the pull-down a previous name
| Buddy                      | An input where you can enter the name of you Buddy, or you can choose with the pull-down a previous name
| Rating                     | A pull-down where you can rate your dive
| Suit                       | An input where you can track the exposure protection suit you were wearing
| Visibility                 | A pull-down where you can rate the visibility underwater
| Air Temp in deg. C/F       | An input where you can enter the air temperature
| Dive Tags                  | Check boxes allowing you to describe the dive (e.g. shore & wreck)
| Notes                      | A free input where you can enter information about your dive. What you've seen, etc.
|===============================================================================

Now you can add information that is missing. Let's start with
completing the example:

In this example we use the following information:

[width="70%",cols="<33%,67%"]
|===============================================================================
| Location    | Oostvoornse Meer
| Dive Master | S. de Vries
| Buddy       | S. de Vries
| Rating      | 3 stars
| Suit        | 7mm wet
| Notes       | First dive here. Good visibility. Did see the concrete poles, some crab and fish. Very nice and easy dive. +
                        Made movie with headcam.
|===============================================================================

Now don't press OK yet!

[[S_EditEquipmentInfo]]
Edit Equipment Info
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You also want to edit your Cylinder information and in the
<<S_EditDiveInfo, previous chapter>>, this was not edited. There is
still another item to edit in the Dive Info screen: 'Cylinder'

[width="90%",cols="<33%,67%",options="header"]
|===============================================================================
| Field    | Description of field
| Cylinder | A double-click field set. Here you can edit your Cylinder information
|===============================================================================

So, when you double click on the cylinder info or press the 'Edit' button, you get another
pop-up.

image::images/cylinder.png["Edit Cylinder",align="center"]

This pop-up window contains the following information:
[width="90%",cols="<33%,67%",options="header"]
|===============================================================================
| Field                       | Description of field
| Cylinder                    | Pull-down where you can choose your Cylinder, or add your own
| Size                        | The volume if not `filled'
| Pressure                    | The maximum pressure of this Cylinder
| Start Pressure _(optional)_ | What was the pressure starting the dive
| End Pressure   _(optional)_ | What was the pressure ending the dive
| Gasmix         _(optional)_ | What was the percentage O2 and He of the blend
|===============================================================================

Now we are going to enter the data:
[width="40%",cols="<34%,33%,33%",options="header"]
|===============================================================================
| Cylinder | Size | Pressure
| 15.0 l   | 15.0 | 220
|===============================================================================

Now tick the option for Start & End pressure and enter the pressures:
[width="40%",cols="<50%,50%",options="header"]
|===============================================================================
| Start Pressure | End Pressure
| 180            | 60
|===============================================================================

Press 'OK'.

In very much the same way you can enter the weight you were carrying on
the dive. Subsurface tracks the following:
[width="90%",cols="<33%,67%",options="header"]
|===============================================================================
| Field  | Description of field
| Type   | Specific type of weight system, like weight belt, integrated pockets
| Weight | Amount of weight (by default in kg, but can be switched to use lbs)
|===============================================================================

Enter the following data:
[width="40%",cols="<50%,50%",options="header"]
|===============================================================================
| Type       | Weight
| Integrated | 13kg
|===============================================================================

Press 'OK'.

Now your dive information for this dive is complete. You can now press
'OK' in the Dive Info screen and view the results.

[[S_EditEvents]]
Edit Events and Gas Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Depending on your dive computer and the specific dive that you are
looking at, a number of events may be indicated by small yellow
triangles within the dive profile. Hovering the mouse pointer over
such an event will show a short explanation of the event in the
tooltip window. On some dive computers few or no events are shows,
other dive computers create these events rather agressively. At times
you may want to remove some of these events, either because they were
created in error (an accidental 'marker' or 'bookmark' set during a
dive) or because the information provided is not useful to you.

You can either do this by filtering out these events (as explained in
the <<S_FilterMenu, Filter Menu section>>), or by outright deleting
these events from the XML file. In order to do that, point at the
event-triangle with your mouse (it is actually sufficient to have the
mouse point at the point in time when the event happened) and
right-click. A context menu will allow you to remove the event from
the dive.

In the same way (by picking the correct time with the mouse pointer),
certain events can be added to a dive profile from the right-click
context menu. At this point only 'bookmark' events and 'gas change'
events can be added. The latter ones are especially useful when diving
with multiple tanks but with a dive computer that only supports one
gas, or when forgetting to switch the dive computer to a different
tank during the dive.

Please note that the gas that you want to switch to must have already
been added to the Equipment list before it can be used here.  See the
<<S_EditEquipmentInfo, previous section on Editing Equipment Info>>
for reference.

[[S_ViewInfoStats]]
View Dive Info & Stats
----------------------

After adding all the information, you can use the tab 'Dive Info' and
the 'Stats tab'. These tabs will provide you with lots of (statistical
and calculated) information regarding your dive.

The information contains:

**Dive Info:**
[width="90%",cols="<33%,67%",options="header"]
|===============================================================================
| Field      | Description of field
| Date       | Date and time of your dive
| Dive Time  | Duration of your dive
| Surf Intv  | Interval between previous dive and this dive
| Max Depth  | Maximum depth of this dive
| Avg Depth  | The average depth of this dive
| Visibility | The visibility under water
| Water Temp | Lowest temperature of the water
| Air Temp   | The temperature of the air at the surface
| Air Press  | The air pressure at the surface
| SAC        | The amount of Surface Air Consumption liters per minute
| OTU        | The Oxygen Toxicity Units of this dive
| O2/He      | Amount of Oxygen/Helium
| Gas Used   | The total volume of gas used during this dive
|===============================================================================

**Statistics:**
[width="90%",cols="<33%,67%",options="header"]
|===============================================================================
| Field               | Description of field
| Dives               | Number of dives covered (usually one, unless you select more dives)

| Max/Min/Avg SAC     | Highest / lowest / average Surface Air Consumption of your covered dives
|===============================================================================

Since the statistics cover all selected dives this feature can be used
to do some more selective analysis of your dives. You can sort your
dives based on one of the columns and then easily select all the dives
with a certain value in that column (for example, all dives in a dry
suit). Or you can use the Filter->Select Tags... menu to only display
dives that include a certain tag, select some or all of those dives
and now see statistics for those dives.

There is also a yearly statistics option that is reachable from the menu 'Log -
Yearly Statistics'. These statistics show you information on how many dives you
have done per year and how long you spent below surface in total (during each
year). You can also dig into a monthly level displaying the same information on
monthly basis. Following information is given for each year (and month when expanded):

[width="90%",cols="<33%,67%",options="header"]
|===============================================================================

| Minimum             | The minimum temperature of the dives
| Maximum             | The maximum (minimum) temperature of the recorded dives
|===============================================================================

[[S_SettingUpPreferences]]
Setting up Preferences
----------------------

Subsurface has the ability to modify the preferences you want. By
using menu 'File - Preferences' you will be presented a pop-up. The pop-up
has two tabs: 'General Settings' and 'Tec Settings' as shown below.

image::images/preferences.png["Preferences",align="center"]

The General Settings allow you to select units, columns to be shown, the
font used for the dive list and the default file that contains the dive data.
It is also posible to choose from a number of map providers.

The Tec Settings offer extra columns to show, settings for more graphs and
information to be shown in the dive profile and settings for GFlow and
GFhigh.

In General Settings you are free to choose what your preference are
for the units to be displayed. You are not restricted to use all
Metric or all Imperial, any combination is fine.

You can set the following options with 'Units':

[width="90%",cols="<33%,67%",options="header"]
|===============================================================================
| Field        | Units to be displayed
| Depth        | Your diving depth in Meters or Feet
| Pressure     | The pressure of your tank(s) in Bar/Ato or PSI (Pounds per Square Inch)
| Volume       | The volume of your tank(s) in Liter (at sea level) or CuFt (Cubic Feet) (at working pressure)
| Temperature  | The temperature of the water in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit
| Weight       | The weight of your weight system in kg or lbs
|===============================================================================

As mentioned earlier when discussing the information visible in the
dive list at the bottom of the main Subsurface window, you can
enable or disable some of the colums that can be shown there:

[width="90%",cols="<33%,67%",options="header"]
|===============================================================================
| Column type | Description
| Temp        | Shows the temperature of your dive
| Cyl         | Shows the cylinder(s) of your dive
| O2%         | Shows the O2% of your dive
| SAC         | Shows the SAC of your dive (Surface Air Consumption)
| Weight      | Shows the total weight carried
| Suit        | Shows the suit you were wearing
|===============================================================================

With 'Divelist Font', you can change the font used in the dive list,

And you can use 'Default XML Data File' to specify which file contains
the data the program will use by default (the program tries to pick a
reasonable default on all three supported operating systems.

The other tab holds the 'Tec Settings'
You can select more columns to be shown with 'Show Columns':

[width="90%",cols="<33%,67%",options="header"]
|===============================================================================
| Column type | Description
| OTU         | The number of Oxygen Toxicity Units
| maxCNS      |The maximum Central Nervous System oxygen toxicity
|===============================================================================

The 'Profile Setting' allow you to show extra information in the dive profile:

[width="90%",cols="<33%,67%",options="header"]
|===============================================================================
| Setting                              | Description
| Show pO2 graph                       | Show a graph of the oxygen partial pressure (with a threshold, default 1.6)
| Show pN2 graph                       | Show a graph of the nitrogen partial pressure (with a threshold, default 4.0)
| Show pHe graph                       | Show a graph of the helium partial pressure (with a threshold, default 13.0)
| Show MOD                             | Show the Maximum Operating Depth of the used gas-mix (for the given max. ppO2, default 1.6)

| Show dc reported ceiling in red      | Show the ceiling as reported by the dive computer
| Show calculated ceiling              | Show the ceiling as calculated by Subsurface
| 3m increments for calculated ceiling | The calculated ceiling is not continuous, but increments in 3m steps
| GFlow                                | Set the Low Gradient Factor (default 30)
| GFhigh                               | Set the High Gradient Factor (default 75)
|===============================================================================


I will give an example here:

I am a diver in The Netherlands, using the Metric System. Therefor, I
go to the menu File, choose Preferences here. In the Units section, I
use the following:

 - Depth:	Meter
 - Pressure:	Bar
 - Volume:	Liter
 - Temperature:	Celsius
 - Weight:	kg

I would like to see the:

 - Temperature
 - Show Cyl
 - Show O2%
 - Show SAC

Clicking 'OK' on the dialog stores these settings.

[[S_ImportingAlienDiveLogs]]
Importing Divelogs from other Software
--------------------------------------

Subsurface will import divelogs from a couple of other log software. We
support currently XML exports from DivingLog, divelogs.de and Suunto
DiveManager. Native format of JDiveLog and MacDive are imported as well.

When importing dives subsurface tries to detect multiple records for
the same dive and merges the information as best as it can. So as long
as there are no time zone issues (or other reasons that would cause the
beginning time of the dives to be substantially different) subsurface
will not create duplicate entries.

[[S_ImportingDivesJDiveLog]]
Importing Dives from JDiveLog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Maybe you have been using JDiveLog and you have a lot of dives logged in
this program. You don't have to type all information by hand into
Subsurface, because you can import your divelogs from JDiveLog.

JDiveLog stores its information into files with the extension of .jlb.
These .jlb contain all the information that has been stored, except your
images in XML format.

By using the menu 'File - Import File(s)' you get a popup asking
for the file name.  To import your JDiveLog file(s) do the following:

 - Open 'File - Import File(s)' on the menu
 - Browse your directories to the location where your *.jlb file is
 - Select your existing *.jlb file and click 'open'
 - Click the OK button in the popup

After a few moments, you see your existing logs in Subsurface. Now you can
edit your dives like explained in <<S_EditDiveInfo, chapter Editing the Dive Info>>.

Information that is imported from JDiveLog into the location field:

 - Extended dive location information

Information that is merged into the location or notes field:

 - Used amount of weight
 - Used type of suit
 - Used type of gloves
 - Type of dive
 - Dive activity

Alternatively, you can start subsurface with the --import command line
which will have the same effect:

      subsurface MyDives.xml --import JDiveLogDives.jlb

will open your divelog (assuming that's called MyDives.xml) and then
import the dives from JdivelogDives.jlb. You can now save the combined
divelog back as MyDives.xml.

[[S_ImportingDivesSuunto]]
Importing dives from Suunto Divemanager 3.*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can start importing dives from Suunto Divemanager, you first
have to export the dives you want to import. Subsurface does not import
directly from the Suunto Divemanager log files. The following procedures
unpacking instructions for Linux and Windows.

Export from Suunto Divemanager
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 - Start Suunto Divemanager and login with the name containing the logs
 - Do not start the import wizard to import dives from your computer.
 - In the navigation tree on the left side of the program-window, select your dives.
 - Within the list of dives, select the dives you would like to import later:
	* To select certain dives: hold ctrl and point & click the dive
	* To select all dives:  Select the first dive, hold down shift and select the last dive
 - With the dives marked, use the program menu 'File - Export'
 - The export pop-up will show
 - Within this pop-up, there is one field called Export Path.
	* Click the button browse next to the field Export Path
		** A file-manager like window pops up
		** Navigate to the directory where you want to store the Divelog.SDE file
		** Optional change the name of the file you want to save
		** Click 'Save'
	* You are back in the Export pop-up. Press the button 'Export'
 - Your dives are now exported to the file Divelogs.SDE.

Reading Suunto Divemanager Export in Subsurface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The file Divelogs.SDE can now be opened (or imported) in
Subsurface. Different from earlier versions of Subsurface, no manual
unpacking of the .SDE file is needed anymore.

[[S_ImportingDivesSuuntoDM4]]
Importing dives from Suunto DM4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To import divelog from Suunto DM4, you need to locate the DM4 database
where the dives are stored. You can either look for the original
database or take a backup of the dives. Both methods are described here.

Locating the Suunto DM4 database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 - Start Suunto DM4
 - Select 'Help - About'
 - Click 'Copy' after text 'Copy log folder path to clipboard'
 - Now open Windows Explorer
 - Paste the address to the path box at the top of the File Explorer
 - The database is called DM4.db

Backing up Suunto DM4
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 - Start Suunto DM4
 - Select 'File - Create backup'
 - From the file menu select the location and name for the backup, we'll
   use DM4 in here with the default suffix .bak
 - Click 'Save'
 - Your dives are now exported to the file DM4.bak

Reading Suunto DM4 backup in Subsurface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Importing the logs from DM4 does not require any special steps. You just
do the following:

 - Open the following menu 'File - Import File(s)'
 - Browse your directories to the location where your DM4 backup is
   stored
 - Select the backup file you want to import and click 'Open'

It is also possible to do the importing from command line just like with
JDiveLog (see <<S_ImportingDivesJDiveLog, chapter Importing Dives from JDiveLog>>):

      subsurface MyDives.xml --import DM4.bak

[[S_ImportingMacDive]]
Importing Dives from MacDive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Importing logs from MacDive is as easy as it gets. Do the following
steps in Subsurface:

 - Open the following menu 'File - Import File(s)'
 - Browse your directories to the location where your MacDive logs are
   stored
 - Select the log file(s) you want to import and click 'open'
 - Click the OK button in the popup

After a few moments, you see your existing logs in Subsurface. Now you can
edit your dives like explained in <<S_EditDiveInfo, chapter Editing the Dive Info>>.

We currently attempt to import all the relevant dive information
excluding the used equipment and diver name.

It is also possible to do the importing from command line just like with
JDiveLog (see <<S_ImportingDivesJDiveLog, chapter Importing Dives from JDiveLog>>):

      subsurface MyDives.xml --import MacDiveDives.xml

[[S_ImportingDivelogsDe]]
Importing Dives from divelogs.de
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can start importing dives from divelogs.de, you first
have to export the dives you want to import. The exported DLD file can
be imported to Subsurface either from command line or from GUI.

Export from divelogs.de
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 - Login to https://en.divelogs.de with your account
 - Go to the 'Export Logbook' page
 - Choose 'DLD Export of your logbook' and save the resulting yourUserName.DLD file

Import divelogs.de to Subsurface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The import works similarly as importing any other divelogs. Just do the
following steps on Subsurface:

 - Open the following menu 'File - Import File(s)'
 - Browse your directories to the location where yourUserName.DLD is
 - Select the log file and click OK

After a few moments, you see your existing logs in Subsurface. Now you can
edit your dives like explained in <<S_EditDiveInfo, chapter Editing the Dive Info>>.

The fields that are currently not imported are: weather, visibility and
boat.

It is also possible to do the importing from command line just like with
JDiveLog (see <<S_ImportingDivesJDiveLog, chapter Importing Dives from JDiveLog>>):

      subsurface MyDives.xml --import yourUserName.DLD

[[S_ImportingDivinglog]]
Importing Dives from DivingLog 5.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can start importing dives from DivingLog you first have to
export those dives. Unfortunately DivingLog XML files give us no
indication on the preferences set on your system. So in order for
Subsurface to be able to successfully import XML files from DivingLog
you first need to make sure that your copy of DivingLog is configured
to use the Metric system (you can easily change this in 'File -
Preferences - Units and Language' by clicking the 'Metric'
button). Then do the following:

 - Open the 'File - Export - XML' menu
 - Select the dives that you want to export
 - Click on the export button and select the filename
 - Rename the backup file to extension .db

This file can now be opened in Subsurface (as described in the previous sections).

[[S_Importingkenozooid]]
Importing Dives from kenozooid
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

kenozooid is using UDDF to store dives and is tested to work togehter with Subsurface.
Make sure you are not using compressed files when importing to Subsurface
 or uncompress them manually before).

[[S_ImportingDR5]]
Importing Dives from DR5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Heinrichs Weikamp DR5 will save a single UDDF file for every dive which is available
through the filesystem when mounted as USB drive. Mark all the dives you'd like to
import or open, Subsurface is tested to work with DR5.
Note: The DR5 does not seem to store gradient factors nor deco information, so for
Subsurface it is not possible to display them. Use the inbuild deco overlay in Subsurface
to get deco displayed but please note that the deco calculated by Subsurface
will most likely differ from the one display at the DR5. Adjust the gradient
factors in the Tec Settings in Subsurface.

[[S_ImportingUDDF]]
Importing UDDF Dives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Subsurface is supporting UDDF as import format in general. It may happen that
single attributes inside your file will not get processed properly.

Please report your findings for UDDF data from different sources than descibed
in this document at http://trac.hohndel.org[our bugtracker] or send an email to
mailto:subsurface@hohndel.org[our mailing list].

[[S_Exporting]]
Exporting dives from Subsurface
-------------------------------

We currently support exporting the divelog to UDDF format and directly uploading to divelogs.de.

[[S_UploadingDivelogsDe]]
Uploading Dives to divelogs.de
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Subsurface supports uploading dives directly to divelogs.de. You can upload
either selected dives or all the dives. When selecting to upload, you are
presented a simple dialog for user name and password.

[NOTE]
The password is displayed on screen and is stored in the configuration
file / registry in clear-text. Please do not use this feature if you have
security concerns with this. Also note that when running Subsurface on
Windows at this point the connection to divelogs.de is established through
an http link, so your login credentials and uploaded data can easily be
captured by other people on the same network.

image::images/upload_divelogs_de.png["Upload to divelogs.de",align="center"]

Note that uploading dives to divelogs.de requires Internet
connectivity and cannot be done off-line.

.Uploading selected dives to divelogs.de

Mark the dives to be uploaded in the dive list. Click right mouse button on one
of the selected dives and select the menu 'Upload dive(s) to divelogs.de'.

.Uploading all dives to divelogs.de

You can of course mark all the dives and upload them using the right mouse
button menu. However, you can also select menu 'File - Upload to
divelogs.de...'

[[S_ExportingUDDF]]
Exporting dives to UDDF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you select dives and choose the exporting option from right click menu, you get a dialog asking where to save the file. Similarly when you select the menu 'File - Export UDDF' you can export all the dives to UDDF file of your choosing.

[[S_DivePlanning]]
Planning Dives
--------------

Subsurface includes a still rather experimental dive planning feature
that allows the creation of dive plans for both recreational scuba
equipment (open circuit) and rebreathers (closed circuit
equipment). This allows users to experiment with different plans and
see the effects of changing various parameters of the dives.

[WARNING]
Deco calculations are done using a new implementation of the Buhlmann
ZH-L16 algorithm with gradient factors. Since the planner and our
implementation of the decompression algorithms are new and have received
only a limited amount of testing: +
**WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND NOT TO PLAN DIVES SIMPLY BASED ON THE
RESULTS GIVEN HERE.**

When you start the planner, a dialog appears as shown in the following
screen capture:

image::images/dive_planning.png["Dive Planning",align="center"]

In order to plan a dive some basic information needs to be entered:

 - planned start time of the dive
 - air consumption
 - planned depths
 - planned segment times

Additionally there is an option to plan the last deco stop at 6m/20ft
instead of the otherwise used final stop at 3m/10ft.

There is also other information available for those who
are familiar with dive planning or use closed circuit rebreathers.

[width="90%",cols="<25%,<75%"]
|===============================================================================
| Dive starts		| Start time of the dive; '+60:00' means that the dive is 60 minutes in the future
| Surface Pressure	| Air pressure on surface, default 1013 should suffice for most
| SAC during dive	| Air consumption during the dive, use conservative value based on your own air consumption e.g. 20l/min
| SAC during decostop	| Air consumption during decompression stop, e.g. 17 l/min
| GFlow		| Gradient factor low value affects the ceiling calculation, leave to default if you are not familiar with GF
| GFhigh		| Gradient factor high value affects the ceiling calculation, leave to default if you are not familiar GF
| **Ending Depth**	| Depth where current segment ends; a different depth from the previous segment creates a transition segment for ascent or descent, keeping the same depth creates a segment at the given depth. By default the planner uses the measurement for length set in the preferences (meters for most users) - this can be overridden by explicitly specifying 'm' or 'ft'.
| **Segment Time**	| Enter time in minutes; segment duration / relative time can be  indicated by an optional '+':  '+3' or '+3:00' creates a segment that lasts 3 minutes, add an at sign like '@7' for a segment that ends 7 minutes after the start of the dive.
| **Gas Used**		| Breathing gas mix used; the parser is reasonably flexible and understands terms like AIR, EAN32, 36% or 15/50 (compressed air, 32% nitrox, 36% nitrox or 15% O₂ / 50% He trimix, respectively); leaving this field empty indicates continued use of the previous gas, air by default
| **CC SetPoint**	| SetPoint when diving with a closed circuit rebreather. Leave empty for open circuit dives with standard scuba equipment
|===============================================================================

The last four elements are repeated for each segment of a planned dive.
To illustrate the functionality let's plan a dive to 20 meters lasting 20
minutes at that depth and another 10 minutes at 10 meters. We'll only
concentrate on the dive profile here filling the segments.

[width="30%",cols="<33%,<33%,34%",options="header"]
|===============================================================================
| Ending Depth | Segment Time | Gas Used
| 20	| +3	| AIR
| 20	| +20	|
| 10	| +1:30	|
| 10	| +10	|
|===============================================================================

So we define the ending depth for the first segment to be 20 meters
(assuming metric preferences, you can also define the depth explicitly
to m or ft). We will take it easy and descent takes 3 minutes from
surface to the planned depth. Then we spend 20 minutes at 20m breathing
the same gas mixture as the previous step (used gas is left empty).

Ascent to 10 meters will take one and half minutes that is slower than
the fastest recommendation. However, as you can see in Subsurface's
calculations it is still marked with yellow, meaning somewhat
conservative speed (green would be conservative and red on the fast
side). After the defined 10 minutes at a constant depth of 10 meters we let
Subsurface calculate how we will surface.

If decompression is required these stops are taken into account and
can be easily visualized by setting the first depth to e.g. 40 meters
(somewhat dependent on the GF settings). For the ascent phase of the
dive calculation Subsurface assumes a typical 9m/min (30ft/min) ascent
speed.

If needed more segments can be added by clicking 'Add waypoint'.

To add the dive to the divelist simply click 'OK'. Double-clicking on
the planned dive will show the details, including a written diveplan in
the Notes.

The dive we defined earlier will present itself like this:

<5> The planner tries to estimate the needed amount of gas based on the plan and SAC

Following image shows the resulting profile along with a glimpse of the
aforementioned dive plan:

image::images/planned_dive.png["Planned Dive",align="center"]

[[S_Webservice,Web Service and Companion App]]
Web Service and Companion App
-----------------------------

This part of Subsurface is a bit of 'work in progress'. We are
developing a companion application for Android that allows you to
track dive sites from your GPS-enabled Android device.

The Subsurface app is available for free in the Google Play store (and
sources are available from our git server). A server side webservice
is running on our infrastructure to capture and store the data
transmitted by the application. An interested user could also run
their own web service (the sources for the web service are also
available).

The Android companion app allows you to store the GPS location and
name of specific dive sites as their name is entered into the
application. It can also operate as a background service and record
positions at regular intervals (this is especially useful when on a
dive boat).

After downloading your dives from your dive computer (or manually
adding them in the Subsurface desktop application) you can then use
this menu item to connect to our back-end server and download the
related location data (and dive site names). Enter your userid (you
got this when registering with the web service) and click
'Download'. If the data was successfully downloaded you can click
apply and Subsurface will match the time stamps of the downloaded
location and site name information with the dives in your log and will
add the GPS locations and dive site names to your dives.

[NOTE]
At this point you can not use the Android Subsurface companion app to
enter dives and then download these dives into the desktop
application. The companion up and webservice can only be used to add
GPS location (and dive site name) to an existing dive in the dive log.

[[S_Menu]]

Within the Log menu, you will find the following sub-items:

 - Download From Dive Computer::   Allows you to download dive information from your dive computer
 - Download From Web Service::     Allows you to download dive information from the webservice (see <<S_Webservice,chapter Web Service and Companion App>>)
 - Edit Device Names::             Allows you to add device nicknames to dive computers
 - Add Dive::	      		   Manually add a dive that you cannot download from an existing computer
 - Renumber::	This option provides you with a pop-up. Within this
			pop-up you can choose what the first number of your dives should be
			for this set of dives.
 - Autogroup::		Toggle the auto group setting (see the discussion in the <<S_SettingUpPreferences,chapter Setting up Preferences>>)

 - Toggle Zoom::        The dive profile tries to convey some first glance information about
			the depth of a dive - so the vertical scaling of the profile always
			show a minimum of 30m / 90ft. This can be changed to be only 10m / 30ft.
 - Yearly Statistics::	Contrary to the Statistics in the main display, these are purely calendar based
 - Dives Locations::    Show an interactive map with locations of the logged dives with GPS coordinates

The View Menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The view menu allows you to choose between the following representations:

 - List::		Show only the list of dives you have made
 - Profile::		Show only the dive profile of the selected dive
 - Info::		Show only the 3 tab information screen
 - Three::		Show the 'default' 3 screen setup
 - Prev DC		Switch to the previous dive computer
 - Next DC		Switch to the next dive computer

[[S_FilterMenu]]
The Filter Menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The filter menu gives you two very different filter selections.

The first one allows you to create a global filter for certain kind of
events that you no longer want to see displayed in the dive profile
view. Normally all events are represented by small yellow triangles,
but some dive computers create a large number of events that the user
may or may not want to see in the profile (some dive computers for
exampel are very agressively creating "ascend speed warnings" that can
clutter the profile). Selecting this menu will open a dialog that
allows you to select which events should be globally disabled (they
will still be stored in the XML file).

Subsurface also allows you to delete specific events from a dive
profile (see <<S_EditEvents, section Edit Events and Gas Changes>>).
As a reminder, his can be done by right-clicking on the specific event
that you want to remove in the dive profile window. Events that are
deleted like this will actually be removed from the XML file as well.

The second entry in the filter menu allows you to display only a
subset of your dives in the dive list, based on specific tags that are
selected in a dialog. This is especially useful when used in
connection with the statistics features of Subsurface.

The Planner Menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This menu opens up a dive planning dialog. The dive planning is described
in <<S_DivePlanning,chapter Planning Dives>>.

The Help Menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Help menu contains the About entry which displays the version and
author information as well as links to the full license under which
Subsurface is developed and to the Subsurface website.

The second entry in the help menu opens the latest online version of
this manual in the default web browser.

[[AppendixB]]
Appendix B: Mac OSX Driver Installation
---------------------------------------

Working out which driver to use for a Mac when using a particular dive computer can
require some experimentation. The libdivecomputer website provides a useful point from
which to start: http://www.divesoftware.org/libdc/drivers.html. It lists a number of
sites for manufacturers of the serial to USB chips which provide the necessary conversions.

Here you have two alternatives. Either you try each of the major drivers in turn until
you find the right one, or you follow some further steps to try and identify the right
driver up front. To determine the required driver up front, first attach the USB download
cable for your dive computer. Next open a terminal window and run the command:

	system_profiler SPUSBDataType > usb.txt

You should end up with a file (usb.txt in this example) which contains the VID/PID information
which can then be used with the URL above to narrow the field. Just open the text file and
compare the information with the table in the drivers section of the web page. This should
point you to the relevant driver manufacturer.  Typically, you then need to navigate to the
relevant sub page for "drivers" and then the one for "VCP drivers."  VCP stands for Virtual
Com Port. You want VCP rather than D2XX drivers, for example. Make sure to download the correct
version for your particular version of OS X.

Downloaded that driver to your Mac and install it in the usual way. Details on how to
install on OS X 10.8 differ from earlier versions due to the new security functions.
Put simply, unless the driver has been digitally signed in an approved way OS X will
block the installation. You can either make some changes to your system security settings
or manually override the block. The latter seems more sensible and only involves
control-clicking the installation package and answering some standard dialogs. The sequence
goes like this:

- download the driver .dmg package to your downloads folder
- right click the downloads folder and navigate to the new dmg package
- control-click the package: a dialog will open stating that the package has not been signed
  and is from an unknown developer and asking whether you really want to proceed
- if happy, you accept the dialog and the package opens and may show you one or more versions
- select the relevant version, click the package installer and that should be it.

You can find a high-level explanation of the new security features from apple here:
https://www.apple.com/osx/what-is/security.html.

Until you have the correct driver installed, subsurface will not be able to connect to your
dive computer. If you try one VCP driver and it still doesn't work, try the next manufacturer
until it does. If you run out of drivers and still can't get things working perhaps
it is time to contact us via the subsurface mail lists.

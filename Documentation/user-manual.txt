1. Introduction:

Besides his family, Linus has another hobby. This is diving. He tries to dive
on nice spots whenever he can. Linus got bored by the fact that there wasn't  a proper dive-log program natively for Linux and decided to write one by himself. This is how Subsurface was 'born'. Right now, the program is under development and from version 1.1 it is already very usable for divers with supported dive-computers.

2. Complete?

Before you are going to read information from your divecomputer to Subsurface, you need some preparation. Do you have the following:

	1. Your Divecomputer - Compatible with libdivecomputer (see list in Appendix A)
	2. Communication interface - Cable to connect your divecomputer to your PC/Laptop/Netbook
	3. Working installation of libdivecomputer (see the build manual how to do this)
	4. Working installation of Subsurface
	5. If needed, the manual of your divecomputer 

3. Start using the program:

When you start the program for the first time, it shows no information at all. This is because the program does not automatically load the already available dive-log files. 

There is a menu, containing 'File', 'Log', 'Filter' and Help.

The screen is devided in 3 area's: 

	Area with 3 tabs: Dive Notes, Equipment, Info & Stats
	Area next to the 3 tabs, which will contain the diagrams
	Area with the dives, which can be sorted by number, date, etc.
	
The first thing you should do, is setting the preferences you want. By using menu 'File - Preferences' you will be presented a popup with the 'Units'. You are free to choose what is your preference, with other words, use Metric or Imperial.

You can set the following options:
	Depth:		Your diving depth in Meters or Feet
	Pressure:	The pressure of your tank(s) in Bar/Ato or PSI (Pressure Square Inch)
	Volume:		The volume of your tank(s) in Liter or CuFt (Cubic Feet) (At sea-level pressure)
	Temperature:	The temperature of the water in Celcius or Fahrenheit
	
In the main screen, you did see in Area 3, some information. In the Columns options, you can enable/disable options you  would like to show there:
	Show Temp:	Shows the temperature of your dive
	Show Cyl:	Shows the cylinder(s) of your dive
	Show O2%:	Shows the 02% of your dive
	Show SAC:	Shows the SAC of your dive (Surface Air Consumption)
	Show OTU:	Shows the OTU of your dive
	
And, you can change the font usage of the program.

I will give an example here:

I am a diver in The Netherlands, using the Metric System. Therefor, I go to the menu File, choose Preferences here. In the Units section, I use the folowing:
	
	Depth:		Meter
	Pressure:	Bar
	Volume:		Liter
	Temperature:	Celcius
	
I would like to see the:
			Temperature 
			Show Cyl
			Show O2%
			Show SAC
	
I don't know yet what the OTU is, because I am a beginner. So I leave this one not enabled.

So, now I am ready to use the program.

4. Reading information from your divecomputer

Before you start fiddeling around with your divecomputer, note that most divecomputers consume more power when they are in the PC-Communication mode. This could drain your battery. Therefor, ensure yourself that you prepaired the installation as mentioned in the build manual and that your divecomputer is compatible!

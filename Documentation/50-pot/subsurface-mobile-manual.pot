"Welcome as a user of _Subsurface_, advanced dive logging software with "
"extensive infrastructure to describe, organize, interpret and print scuba "
"and free dives. _Subsurface_ offers many advantages over other similar "
"software solutions, including compatibility with Windows, Mac-OS/X, Linux "
"(many distributions) and Android (iOS under development). In addition, "
"_Subsurface_ is open-source software that allows downloading dive "
"information from most dive computers."

"_Subsurface-mobile_ is an extension of _Subsurface_ on laptop and tabletop "
"computers. It runs on Android smartphone and tablet devices and is a tool "
"for viewing or sharing dive information at dive sites where a larger "
"computer is not useful. _Subsurface-mobile_ also allows the gathering of GPS "
"locations where dives are performed."

"While _Subsurface-mobile_ allows one to enter and save dive information "
"using an Android device, users of _Subsurface-mobile_ typically use the "
"mobile app as an extension of the laptop/desktop version of _Subsurface_.  "
"This allows the storage of dive logs on the Internet and which can be shared "
"by the Android version as well as the desktop version.  While the desktop "
"version of _Subsurface_ shows much more detailed information for each dive, "
"the mobile version allows one to have a more accessible dive log on a dive "
"trip, useful for proving dive experience to dive shops or to review previous "
"dives."

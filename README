Subsurface - an Open Source Divelog
===================================

Subsurface is able to track multi-tank dives with air, Nitrox or
TriMix. It keeps track of equipment like weights and exposure
protection used, tracks the dice locations (if available including GPS
fixes), dive masters and dive buddies and allows the user to rate
dives and provide additional dive notes. It calculates a wide variety
of statistics of the user's diving and calculates and tracks
information like SAC rate, partial pressures of O2, N2 and H2,
calculated deco information, and many more.

Subsurface allows the user to print out a detailed log book including dive
profiles and other relevant information. The program is localized in about
a dozen languages and well supported by an active developer community.

You are reading the README file of the latest git version, this file
is not tracked as actively as might be desirable, so some of the
information here may be outdated.

The latest public version is Subsurface 2.1, released in October of 2012.

You can get the latest sources from the git repository:

git clone git://subsurface.hohndel.org/subsurface.git .

or

git clone http://subsurface.hohndel.org/subsurface.git .

You can also browse the sources via gitweb.


Building subsurface under Linux
-------------------------------
You need libxml2-devel, libxslt-devel, gtk2-devel, glib-2.0,
gconf2-devel, libssl-devel, libsoup-devel to build this (and
libusb-1.0 if you have libdivecomputer built with it, but then you
obviously already have it installed). Check with your Linux
distribution how to install these packages.

On Debian the package names are different; try libxml2-dev libgtk2.0-dev
libglib2.0-dev libgconf2-dev libssl-dev libsoup2.4-dev, but it seems
the cairo package at least in Squeeze is too old.

You also need to have libdivecomputer installed. The current git
versions of Subsurface assume that you use libdivecomputer version
0.3, which goes something like this:

git clone \
git://libdivecomputer.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/libdivecomputer/libdivecomputer
cd libdivecomputer
git checkout v0.3.0
autoreconf --install
./configure
make
sudo make install

NOTE! Sometimes you may need to tell the main Subsurface Makefile where
you installed libdivecomputer; pkg-config for libdivecomputer doesn't
always work unless the project has been installed by the distro.

Just edit the makefile directly.


Building Subsurface under Windows
---------------------------------
Subsurface builds nicely with MinGW â€“ the official builds are done as
cross builds under Linux (currently on Fedora 17). A shell script to do
that (plus the .nsi file to create the installer with makensis) are
included in the packaging/Windows directory.

The best way to get libdivecomputer to build appears to be

mingw32-configure
mingw32-make
sudo mingw32-make install

Once you have built and installed libdivecomputer you can use

sh packaging/Windows/mingw-make.sh

to then build subsurface.

Building subsurface on a Mac
----------------------------
Install MacPorts and install the dependencies from MacPorts:
sudo port install gtk2 +quartz py27-pygtk +quartz libusb gtk-osx-application \
     automake autoconf libtool libsoup osm-gps-map libzip

Install libdivecomputer:
git clone git://libdivecomputer.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/libdivecomputer/libdivecomputer
cd libdivecomputer
autoreconf --install
LIBUSB_CFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include ./configure
make
sudo make install

Install subsurface:
git clone git://subsurface.hohndel.org/subsurface.git
cd subsurface
PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/" make
sudo make install-macosx

More instructions on how to create a Subsurface DMG can be found in
packaging/macosx/README


Usage:
======

Install and start from the desktop (or you can run it locally from the
build directory).

./subsurface

You can give a data file as command line argument, or Subsurface picks a
default file for you when started from the desktop or with out an
argument.

If you have a dive computer supported by libdivecomputer, you can just
select "Download from Divecomputer" from the Log menu, tell it what dive
computer you have (and where it is connected if you need to), and hit
"OK".

NOTE! There are often multiple models of dive computers that import
exactly the same way.  If you have a Suunto Gekko, for example, the
import function works fine - even if you don't find the Gekko listed
explicitly.  It has the same import engine as the older Suunto Vyper
(not "Vyper Air").

So check the (incomplete?) list of supported dive computers below, and
see which ones show up together.  If you have the "Aeris Elite T3", for
example, you'd notice that it's in the same group with the "Oceanic Atom
2", and use that choice to import.

 * Solution

 * Eon, Solution Alpha and Solution Nitrox/Vario

 * Vyper, Cobra, Vytec, Vytec DS, D3, Spyder, Gekko, Mosquito, Stinger and Zoop

There is a mailing list for developers: subsurface@hohndel.org
Go to http://lists.hohndel.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/subsurface
to subscribe.

If you want to contribute code, please either send signed-off patches or
a pull request with signed-off commits.  If you don't sign off on them,
we will not accept them. This means adding a line that says
"Signed-off-by: Name <email>" at the end of each commit, indicating that
you wrote the code and have the right to pass it on as an open source
patch.

See: http://gerrit.googlecode.com/svn/documentation/2.0/user-signedoffby.html

Also, please write good git commit messages.  A good commit message
looks like this:

	Header line: explaining the commit in one line

	Body of commit message is a few lines of text, explaining things
	in more detail, possibly giving some background about the issue
	being fixed, etc etc.

	The body of the commit message can be several paragraphs, and
	please do proper word-wrap and keep columns shorter than about
	74 characters or so. That way "git log" will show things
	nicely even when it's indented.

	Reported-by: whoever-reported-it
	Signed-off-by: Your Name <youremail@yourhost.com>

where that header line really should be meaningful, and really should be
just one line.  That header line is what is shown by tools like gitk and
shortlog, and should summarize the change in one readable line of text,
independently of the longer explanation.

A bit of Subsurface history:
----------------------------

In fall of 2011, when a forced lull in kernel development gave him an
opportunity to start on a new endeavor, Linus Torvalds decided to tackle
his frustration with the lack of decent divelog software on Linux.

Subsurface is the result of the work of him and a team of developers since
then. It now supports Linux, Windows and MacOS and allows data import from
a large number of dive computers and several existing divelog programs. It
provides advanced visualization of the key information provided by a
modern dive computer and allows the user to track a wide variety of data
about their diving.

Testing subsurface:

Right now to test subsurface you need to have the 'cmake' executable
to compile the source code of the tests and run them.

1 - create a folder 'build-tests' on the project root directory
2 - run cmake ( cmake .. )
3 - compile the software by invocking make
4 - run the tests by invocking make test
(optional 5) if the tests are failing, a better way to see what's
happening is to run ctest -V , this way the tests will still fail,
but more verbosically - easyer to track them down.

to create a new test, just implement copy the one provided by
example in the tests folder and add the last three lines of the CMakeLists.txt file
adapted to your test.

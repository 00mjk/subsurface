			Subsurface 3.0
			==============

The Subsurface developer team is proud to announce the release of the
latest version of Subsurface.

Subsurface is an open source divelog program that runs on Windows, Mac
and Linux.

Subsurface is able to track single- and multi-tank dives using air,
Nitrox or TriMix. Dive profile is displayed with all related
information, including air consumption and alarms. It also allows
logging of weights and exposure protection used, dive masters and dive
buddies and enables the user to rate dives and provide additional dive
notes.

With Subsurface the user can track dive locations including GPS
coordinates (which can also be conveniently entered using a map
interface). Subsurface calculates a wide variety of statistics of the
user's diving and keeps track of information like the user's SAC rate,
partial pressures of O2, N2 and He, calculated deco information, and
many more.

One of the major strengths of Subsurface is its support of a wide range
of dive computers (most common dive computers are supported, a
detailed list is at
http://subsurface.hohndel.org/documentation/supported-dive-computers).
Subsurface can also import existing dive logs from several sources
including MacDive, Suunto DM3, JDivelog and divelogs.de. Another
strength is its ability to visualize the depth profile (and, if
available, the tank pressure curve) in very innovative ways that give
the user additional information on relative velocity (and momentary
air consumption) during the dive.

New in this version (compared to Subsurface 2.1):

- Many new divecomputers supported, bugfixes for existing divecomputers
  - Cressi Leonardo, Seemann XP5, Mares Matrix, Mares Puck Pro, Mares
    Nemo Wide 2, Shearwater Petrel, Shearwater Predator, Aeris A300
    AI, Hollis DG03
  - significant improvements for the Heinrichs Weiskamp OSTC
- Significantly improved selection of divecomputers for direct download
- Map display of GPS locations of dives and ability to enter and edit those
- Improved automatic dive numbering
- Data overlay for profile plot (with additional statistics information)
- Zoom function for profile plot
- Dive planner
- Improved printing support
- Improved dive trip handling
- Support for downloading dives from multiple computers (so for example
  both your main and your backup computer)
- Added ability to import existing divelogs from Suunto DM3 (no manual
  unpacking needed anymore), MacDive and divelogs.de
- Lots of features to make tec divers happy:
  - Experimental deco calculation with optional display of a calculated
    ceiling (Buhlmann ZH16 with gradient factors)
  - Display of deco information from some divecomputers that support this
  - TriMix support
  - CCR support (fixed or variable setpoint, on dive computers that support
    this)
  - Optional pO2, pN2 and pHe graphs
  - CNS tracking for supported divecomputers
- Lots of bug fixes

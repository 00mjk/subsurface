Tool repo to crosscompile subsurface for iOS
--------------------------------------------

Dependencies:

0. This only works on a Mac
1. XCode with iOS SDK and Qt5.5. See below
2. cmake
3. ant
4. dependencies of libdivecomputer and subsurface -
   visit http://subsurface.hohndel.org/documentation/building/

Steps to install:

Step 1.
Install current XCode with the iOS SDK
And QT for android from: http://qt-project.org/downloads, including the iOS bits

Step 2.
Extract and install these into known directories.
Have a look in the top of build.sh for where the cross build tool expects
them. By default thats is: ../../../Qt/5.5

Step 2.
Run bash build.sh in the terminal.
The script will download and build the whole dependency chain.

After this, Subsurface-mobile will be built for iOS.

The output folder is subsurface-build-ios and your newly created package shows
up as:
subsurface-build-ios/.... something

Known issues running Subsurface on Mac OS X
===========================================

Security Preferences in Mac OS 10.8 Mountain Lion
---------------------------------------- --------

If you get "Subsurface can't be opened because it is from an unidentified
developer" or "Subsurface can't be opened because it was not downloaded
from the Mac App Store.", you need to change your security preferences.

Go to System Preferences » Security & Privacy » General and set
Allow applications downloaded from » Anywhere

Missing dialogues
-----------------

There's a bug that sometimes prevents dialogues from popping up.
The workaround for this is to move the mouse pointer.
